A small visualization project depicting the quantity of Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfer Dioxide, and  Carbon Monoxide across a number of Indian cities from the years of 2015 and 2020. Data was queried using SQL and displayed using Tableau.

## Tools
Data was queried extracted using PostgresSQL in combination with Microsoft Excel. The final visualization storymap was created with Tableau.

## Insights
We see that the cities of Ahmedabad, Delhi,Bengaluru, Lucknow, and Patna have the most sizeable numbers of SO2, No2, and CO year-over-year. This perhaps suggests that these cities are important industrial hubs in the country. Such numbers are in alignment with the high pollution levels in India as the nation continues to develop and industrialize, with 51% and 27% of India's pollutants stemming from its industries and vehicles respectively according to The Indian Express.
